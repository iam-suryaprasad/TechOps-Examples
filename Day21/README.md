## Use Case

### KEDA vs Karpenter - Which One to Choose?

Kubernetes practitioners often find themselves unsure whether to choose KEDA or Karpenter, as both offer valuable but distinct approaches to scaling within their clusters.

Letâ€™s understand the basics first..

#### KEDA:
Specializes in scaling your applications based on external event sources, making it perfect for workloads that need to respond to specific events like messages in a queue.

KEDA workflow

. KEDA receives events from sources like Kafka or RabbitMQ.

. The KEDA operator processes these events using its metrics adapter, controller, and scaler.

. Metrics are sent to the Kubernetes API server.

. Kubernetes API server communicates with the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).

. HPA adjusts the number of pods in your deployments based on these metrics.


### Karpenter:

Automatically provisions new nodes specifically when unscheduled pods are detected, ensuring your cluster scales efficiently by adding the exact resources needed.

. Karpenter detects unscheduled pods in the cluster.

. The Karpenter controller defines the provisioning requirements using the Provisioner CRD.

. It interacts with the cloud provider API to provision new nodes.

. Once the nodes are ready, the Kubernetes scheduler assigns the unscheduled pods to these new nodes.

###### When to Use:

KEDA: Ideal for event-driven workloads. If your application scales based on external events or metrics like queue length, Kafka messages, or custom metrics, KEDA integrates seamlessly.

Real-life Applications: Processing orders in e-commerce platforms, handling IoT sensor data, or managing email notifications.

Karpenter: Perfect for dynamic infrastructure scaling. If you need to scale your cluster by adding or removing nodes based on the demands of unscheduled pods, Karpenter is your go-to.

Karpenter efficiently manages cluster capacity, ensuring the right resources are available when workloads fluctuate.

Real-life Applications: Running AI/ML workloads, handling video rendering jobs, or scaling cloud gaming servers.

The right choice depends on the specific needs of your workloads and cluster management strategy.
